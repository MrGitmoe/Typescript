//Basic
//There are 7 basic data types used
{
  string,
  number,
  bigint,
  boolean,
  undefined,
  null,
  symbol
}
Ex.
let firstname: string = 'John'

//Union
//These are variables that can be assigned more than one type
Ex.
let age: number | string;
age = 26;
age = "26";

//Dynamic
//Known as type 'any' will rever TS backinto JS
Ex.
let age: any = 100;
age = true;

//Literal
//Refers to strings and numbers in type positions
Ex.
let direction: 'UP' | 'DOWN';
direction = 'UP';

//Objects
//Objects in TS must have all the correct properties and value types
Ex.
let person: {
  name: string;
  isProgrammer: boolean;
};

person = {
  name: 'John',
  isProgrammer: true,
};
person.age = 26; //Error - no age prop on person object
person.IsProgrammer = 'yes'; //Error - should be boolean
